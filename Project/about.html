            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Our story began when Aaron and Marty Cline fell in love, got married, and had two wild and crazy boys. Our love for speed began at an early age. We would race anything we had, from bicycles to scooters to dirt bikes. We enjoy racing through the mountains of southern West Virginia every chance we get. As we got older, our toys got bigger as well. Come on down to the track with us and have a great time.</p><br><br>

            <h2>Aaron</h2>
            <p>Aaron found his love for speed at an early age racing dirt bikes through the mountains. He later would take up driving stock cars on the local dirt tracks. He also likes to build and drive woods buggies throughout southern West Virginia. Aaron works as a mine foreman at a surface mine when he is not spending time with his family.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Bradley</h2>
            <p>Bradley has been going fast before he could even walk. Rumor has it, he put a turbo on his baby stroller. He has always enjoyed working on cars, trucks, motorcycles, or pretty much anything with a motor since he could turn a wrench. He works as a coal miner when he is not building his next racecar. Remember, "Do it for Dale".</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Sammy</h2>
            <p>Sammy didn't have any other choice but to race his brother everywhere they went, but he loves every minute of it. When it comes to drag racing, if you ain't first, then you're second. Sammy works as the chief mechanic for United Rentals but one day hopes to be driving a Top Fuel Dragster.</p>
